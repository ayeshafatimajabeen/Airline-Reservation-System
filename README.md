##  Airline Reservation System

-  **Database Design**: Normalized real-world entities like Flights, Customers, Bookings, and Seats into relational tables.
-  **Relationships & Constraints**: Used primary keys, foreign keys, and checks to maintain data integrity.
-  **Stored Procedures**: Automated repetitive tasks like seat generation using custom procedures.
-  **Triggers**: Implemented business logic (e.g., updating seat availability) through `AFTER INSERT` and `AFTER UPDATE` triggers.
-  **Data Analysis**: Built complex SQL queries and views for booking reports, availability tracking, and revenue summaries.
-  **Real-World Simulation**: Simulated a backend airline system that could connect to a real or frontend application.

> This project improved my understanding of SQL, data modeling, automation in MySQL, and applying logic through procedural SQL features.
